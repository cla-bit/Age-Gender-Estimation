# Age-Gender-Estimation: Dash Web Application

***Possible tools to use to visualize the comparative analysis: Streamlit dashboard or Plotly Dashboard***


***Run this project on Jupyter IDE***

The "Age-Gender-Estimation" Dash App is a robust and sophisticated application designed to leverage on the power of machine learning to distinctively visualize the classifications of genders and age groups of humans facial features. This app leverages the power of KNN and RF techniques to compare the analysis of these models in all of its metrics .







## Features

- Age Group Classification: Human ages can be grouped into various groups depending on their features.
- Gender Recognition: The application integrates with various data sources. This data is used to assess the techniques to know how fit it is to classify humans based on gender.
- Dataset visualization table
- Age Group visualization chart
- Gender Recognition visualization chart
